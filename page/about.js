                <h2>The Thought Process</h2>

                <p>The main philosophy of VTTES is to provide free and open quality of life, workflow and general improvements to the Roll20 VTT. You can save hours of time by progamming for months. That's exactly why I want to share this with the world</p>

                <p>The primary and only goal of VTTES is to save people's time. Not only when preparing for games, but also when running them and playing in them. Roll20 is not perfect and I have had some repeating frusturating moments (why can't I select this darn token?). VTTES fixes the major quirks I've experienced.</p>
